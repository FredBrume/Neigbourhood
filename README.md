# To-Do
* Add unique functionality beyond the minimum requirements (i.e. the ability to “favorite” a location, etc.).
* Incorporate a build process allowing for production quality, minified code, to be delivered to the client.
* Data persists when the app is closed and reopened, either through localStorage or an external database (e.g. Firebase).
* Include additional third-party data sources beyond the minimum required.
* Style different markers in different (and functionally-useful) ways, depending on the data set.
* Implement additional optimizations that improve the performance and user experience of the filter functionality (keyboard shortcuts, autocomplete functionality, filtering of multiple fields, etc).
* Integrate all application components into a cohesive and enjoyable user experience.
* Completely restyle the so-far barebone map structure. Functionality needs to be reviewed first before stylization.
* May set 1on1 for some guidance...
